        <p>Not Taking It Personally Is Not Helping You</p>

<p>People who take things personally solve problems. This is because, to them, an unsolved problem is a point of failure. Taking things personally results in an unshakeable resolve. Those who take it personally are far more willing to go the distance. When you don’t understand something and you decide that you’re not okay with not understanding it, you’ll do what it takes to figure it out. When things get difficult, the people who haven’t taken it personally are more likely to give up. To them, the cost of figuring it out simply isn’t worth paying. Whether or not this approach supports a healthy work / life balance is outside of the scope of this article, but it certainly is effective for problem solving. It’s up to you to decide what problems are worth taking personally.</p>

<p>Taking things personally can also be beneficial when you’re receiving feedback. I used to pride myself in my ability to receive constructive criticism. That is, until I started working for someone who cared enough about me to provide real, honest feedback. The first couple of times that feedback was provided, I got defensive. I tried justifying why my actions were aligned with my intent. Looking back, I realized that I wasn’t fully acknowledging the feedback, nor was I processing it in a way that could build me up. Rather than letting me continue acting like this, they called me on it. That one hurt. I knew they were right.</p>

<p>I always strive to perform. I’m incredibly hard on myself. This has always kept me off the radars of those dishing out feedback. In my mind, if someone had a way to criticize what I was doing, then it meant that there was a weakness that I hadn’t addressed. Being in a situation that elicited feedback felt like I had failed in a big way. Rather than asking myself why I got defensive, I was dismissive of the feedback. Besides, I shouldn’t take it personally, right?</p>

<p>It is worth noting that not all feedback is accurate, and not everyone who dishes out criticism has your best interest in mind. However, when someone is either highly knowledgeable in the domain, or they truly care about you, it’s worth taking the time to consider their input. Where things go from here depends on the situation; however, if you disagree or need more clarification on the feedback, extending the conversation is worthwhile.</p>

<p>I’ve found that it takes me some time to process some feedback if I’m truly being receptive. That’s perfectly okay. I’ve been called out on some things that I never realized I was doing. In these cases, I’ve had to become more aware of myself and get over the initial emotional response of getting called out. One glaring example of this was when my manager informed me that I was cutting people off mid-sentence when I felt like I understood the point they were trying to communicate but taking longer than necessary to do so. I wasn’t giving people the space they needed to communicate at their pace. That one cut deep. It was painful to hear, but it helped me improve my interpersonal skills in a huge way. You can only grow from feedback when you receive it on a personal level. The introspective work that happens is what creates a growth opportunity.</p>

<p>The intent behind “don’t take it personally” is resilience; yet, it lacks the accountability required to level up. If you want to get the most out of your time at work, and in life in general, then give yourself the freedom to take things personally. Take important things to heart, really sit with sound feedback, have the hard conversations that lead to growth, and do the work required to understand complex things.</p>
